# Election

A client-side application that will talk to our smart contract on the blockchain. 
This client-side application will have a table of candidates that lists each candidate's id, name, and vote count. 
It will have a form where we can cast a vote for our desired candidate. 
It also shows the account we're connected to the blockchain with under "your account".
